## Data Engineering On Azure

The following tools/services are used to design a data platform and are also illustrated in this repo

1. Azure Data Explorer (for ingesting data, storage and analytics)
2. Azure Data Lake Storage (for only storage)
3. Azure Data Factory (for orchestration, a serverless ETL solution)
4. Azure Monitor (real-time alerts, if things goes wrong)
5. Azure Machine Learning (ML model management)
6. Azure Purview (Metadata-as-a-Service, data dictionary)
7. Azure Functions + Azure Cosmos DB (for sharing data via API)
8. Azure Data Share (for sharing data as "Bulk Copy", directly form the storage layer)
